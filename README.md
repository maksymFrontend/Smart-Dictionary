# Smart Dictionary
"Smart dictionary" is an information system that provides functions for storing and studying words, promoting more effective management of a personal vocabulary and improving language proficiency.

"Smart dictionary" is a project that allows users to store words and improve their language skills, as well as features text scanning and recognition. I, in turn, developed both the Frontend and Backend parts of this system. This project is a convenient tool for learning a language and managing a personal vocabulary.

Various technologies were used in the development of the "Smart dictionary" project. SCSS was used for page styling, while React was used on the frontend. The backend was built on Django, written in Python. To effectively handle data, the GraphQL query language was utilized. All of these technologies combined to create a convenient and functional tool for learning languages and managing personal dictionaries.

The performance optimization problem on the frontend was successfully solved in the project. It was noticed that when working with large amounts of data, pages were loading slowly, negatively affecting the user experience. To solve this problem, the React Virtualized library was applied. The result of using the library was a significant improvement in page loading speed and request processing, making the system more user-friendly.
